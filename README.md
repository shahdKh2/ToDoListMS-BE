This is the back-end of the To-Do List Management System, built with Spring Boot. It provides a RESTful API to manage tasks.

## Features

- **Get All Tasks**: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
- **Save New Task**: Add a new task to the list.
- **Update Task**: Update an existing task.
- **Delete Task**: Remove a task from the list.


This back-end works with the [Angular front-end](https://github.com/shahdKh2/ToDoListMS-FE.git) to provide a complete application experience.
